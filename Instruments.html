<h2 id="drums">Drums</h2>
<p>Drummers are the backbone of the entire band.  Without it, the music rarely has the drive or energy
that some genres require.  As a drummer, you will need the following items:</p>
<p>Let's start your drumming journey with a simple 4/4 Beat.</p>
<img src="Assets/simplebeat.jpg">
<p>This exercise shows one of the most basic drum beats for beginners.  The bottom note in this figure
represents the "Kick" drum, the Middle note represents the "Snare" drum, and the top "X" note represents
the "Hi-hat" of a drumset.  Practice this beat with the sheet music and recording provided!</p>

<h2 id="bass">Guitar/Bass</h2>
<p>Let's use the same 90 bpm Tempo from the drum exercise to play this 12-bar blues for Bass and Guitar</p>
<p>If you play the Bass, try reading the tablatures.  Tablatures tell you which "fret" to press down on your
instrument.</p>
<img src="assets/bassexercise.jpg" class="small">
<p>This exercise is called a 12-bar blues, which is a very common piece of music.  Practice to this recording!</p>

<p>Now if you're a guitar player, we're going to do the same exercise.  I advise beginners to learn the bass
part on your guitar first.  The first four strings of your guitar are the same notes as the four strings on a bass!</p>
<img src="Assets/guitarexercise.jpg">
<p>Let's try the 12-bar blues on guitar with this Tablature and recording. The cross symbol with two dots means
to repeat what you just played.</p>

<h2 id="piano">Piano</h2>
<p>So you wanna learn Piano?  Good on you!  It's a tough instrument for beginners, but as long as you practice
daily, you should be able to pick it up quickly.</p>
<img src="Assets/pianoexercise.jpg" class="small">
<p>Let's start with the 12-bar blues exercise.  Play the chords with the recording.  This can also
double as a rhythm guitar part!</p>

<h2 id="vox">Vocals</h2>
<p>You're the singer, you're the spokesperson of the band.  In this exercise, sing along with the various
instruments playing and see if you can match the notes with your voice.</p>
<p>Try singing the bass part first.  When you feel confident, start improvising!  Improvising is a important
skill in music, especially as a vocalist.  See if you can write some simple lyrics to your improv and see
where your voice takes you!</p>

<p>Here is an example improvisation, just in case you're not sure!</p>
